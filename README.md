# CSS ::before and ::after content property not working

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `content` property when used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.  The issue is that despite seemingly correct syntax, no content is displayed. This can be caused by several factors, including missing display property settings or incorrect selector targeting.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected code.
