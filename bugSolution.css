The problem was that the parent element did not have a `display` property set that supported pseudo-elements.  Adding `display: block;` (or `display: inline-block;`, `display: flex;` etc., depending on your layout) to the parent element solved the issue.

```css
.parent {
  display: block;
}

.parent::before {
  content: "This text is now visible!";
}
```

Other potential solutions include:

* **Incorrect selector:** Double-check that your selector correctly targets the element.
* **Missing content:** Ensure that the `content` property is set to a valid value (string, URL, etc.).
* **CSS specificity:**  Check if other styles with higher specificity might be overriding your `content` property.
